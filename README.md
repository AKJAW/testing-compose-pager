This is a companion project for my article [Writing UI Tests for Pager Layouts in Jetpack Compose](https://akjaw.com/wiriting-ui-tests-for-pager-layouts-jetpack-compose/)

The project consist of a Compose Android app with two pager 
screens. One screen has static content and one has dynamic 
content where pages can be added or removed. Both screens 
have corresponding UI tests.
